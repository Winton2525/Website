            <h2 class="anim">Sasuke<br>Uchiha<br></h2>
            <p class="anim"><i>"I Hate A Lot Of Things, And I Don't Particularly Like Anything."</i> - Sasuke Uchiha<br>
                <br>
                <b>Goal:</b> To kill his older brother, Itachi Uchiha, who massacared their entire family and clan.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Description:</b> Sasuke is a talented young Uchiha, gifted with the sharingan - an Ocular <a href="https://naruto.fandom.com/wiki/Kekkei_Genkai">Kekkei Genkai.</a>
                The sharingan enhances the visual abilities of the user, however with time and effort, the sharingan can be mastered, and with that mastery - a host of secrets to be unlocked.<br>
                Throughout the manga and anime, Sasuke is an antisocial, cold and distant individual - and yet despite this, is respected and idiolised by all within the village (he is the complete opposite to Naruto and his situation).<br>
                After his mother and father were slaughtered by his old brother (Itachi), Sasuke made it his lifes mission to become as strong as possible. With this strength - avenge his clan by killing his brother.<br>
                Since the slaughter, Itachi has become even more powerful and has mastered his sharigan, transforming it into the Mangekyō.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Family:</b> Sasuke is a member of the Uchiha clan, one of the three oldest families going back to the founding of Konoha - recognisable from their dōjutsu: The <b>Sharigan</b>. Only a few select members of the clan have had the dōjutsu manifest.<br>
                Sasuke is considered the last of the Uchiha, once his family were all killed and his elder brother became a rogue ninja.<br>
                <br>
                <b>Later Years:</b> Many years later Sasuke kills Itachi, however once he learns the truth behind Itachi's actions - Sasuke vows to kill the village elders and then becoming the Hokage himself, and use the position to "change the way of the world".<br>
                Naruto and Sasuke find themselves on idiologically aposed, both realising the world must change, but Naruto believes it can be done with love, while Sasuke with fear.<br>
                Naruto and Sasuke fight in mortal combat, Naruto wins and spares his once best friend. Sasuke sees how his rage blinded him...
